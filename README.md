#### Sprinkles

This list contains user stories from each of the Epics above that are not required for the MVP but would result in significant improvements for the user experience. These will be implemented as time allows.

- As a **User** I want to **edit my profile details** so that **I can keep my password secure and my email address and other details up to date**

- As a **User** I want to **add/update my profile image** so that **my profile can be more personalised and show some of my personality**

Trello Board: https://trello.com/b/DPS3LJow/full-stack-app

For this project the team made use of Trello for project management. User stories and tasks were converted into cards and given due dates and appropriate labels according to category, priority and estimated time to completion.

![trello labels list](docs/trello/trello-labels-list.png)

![trello labels example](docs/trello/trello-labels-example.png)

Cards were then discussed with the group and assigned to team members to lead and complete. The cards then moved from left to right between lists depending on their current state. "To do", "In Progress", "Review/Testing" and "Complete".

Day 1:
